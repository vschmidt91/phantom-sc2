# TODO

- [x] make sure creep hull is used to stay on creep
- [x] make creep hull update eager (check townhall tags)
- [ ] prefer walking on creep
- [x] prefer expanding onto creep
- [ ] fix overlords building one at a time (prioritization mismatch of pending vs actual?)
- [ ] fix random parameter storage
- [ ] fix corrosive bile (check targeting and confidence check, ravagers yolo a lot)

# CONCEPT NEEDED

- avoid getting farmed at creep edge
- destroy destructables on our creep when we have time
